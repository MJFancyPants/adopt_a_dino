		<h1>Care and Feeding of Your Pet Dino</h1>
		<p>
			Once you've adopted a new dinosaur, it's very important to give it the proper care and food. Here are some useful tips for living with your new Mesozoic friend.

	<div class = "CareTip1">
	     <h3>Be Careful with TV</h3>
	     <img src = "images/withtv.jpg">
	     <p>
	     	Don't let your dinosaur watch too much TV. Many carnivorous dinosaurs are attracted to the movement on the screen. They may end up fascinated for hours and forget to eat or exercise. Or, worse yet, they may mistake the TV for prey and attack it.
	     </P>

	</div>

	<div class = "CareTip2">
	     <h3>Socialization</h3>
	     <img src = "images/withgirl2.jpg">
	     <p>
	     	Many dinosaurs live in the wild in herds, packs or other social groups. If you have a social dinosaur, it's a good idea to schedule playdates with other friends who have the same species. If yours is a pack hunter, take time to convince it you're the alpha.
	     </P>

	</div>


	<div class = "CareTip3">
	     <h3>Proper Feeding</h3>
	     <img src = "images/feed.jpg">
	     <p>
	     	The proper diet is very important for dinosaurs. If you have a carnivore, make sure the meat is fresh. If it has been frozen, thaw it thoroughly and let it at least warm up to room temperature. 
	     	For herbivores, make sure the plants you are feeding them have no poisonous compounds. 
	     </P>
