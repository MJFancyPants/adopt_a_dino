		<p> Right now, thousands of dinosaurs are neglected, abandoned or abused. Often they are given as gifts or taken in as hatchlings, but when they become too big, too ugly, or too much trouble to care for, they are tossed aside like chicken carcasses. But these are living creatures with wants and needs. They need kindness and loving homes.
		</p>

		<p>
		We're Adopt-a-Dino, a non-profit organization dedicated to rescuing, caring for and rehabilitating these magnificent creatures. But we need your help. 
		Won't you consider adopting one of these magnificent creatures today? They will enrich your life!
		If you can't take in a dino, at least consider making even a small donation so we can continue this important work. 
		</p>
